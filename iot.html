								<h3>Project Description</h3>
								<p>	
								The goal of this project was to improve the current method researchers use to study rodent populations by automating the data gathering process. We partnered with a researcher who expressed concern on how tedious and labour intensive the current method is. The current method consists of researchers using live bait traps to capture speciments and then going to check the trap every hour to gather data from the rodent. So, he asked if we could design a system that would automate the data gathering process. That way, the system could be left on its own for hours or days and all the data collected would be saved and ready to be analyzed later. To make the system truly functional for researchers, we had to meet the following requirements: 

									<ul class="alt">
										<li>Collect the weight of rodents.</li>
										<li>
											Take pictures of the speciments.
										</li>
										<li>Get the length of rodents. </li>
										<li>
											Record the temperature and humidity of the environment throughout the day.
										</li>
										<li>
											Have the system be able to run on battery power.
										</li>
										<li>
											Save the data in an easy-to-analyze way. 
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<p>
									Considering these requirements, we developed a system that could collect all the mentioned data by using dedicated sensors that take the measurements and feed them to an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi. The data for each rodent would be saved on an independent CSV file, in a folder with all the pictures taken from the specimen. The Average of all weight, temperature and humidity recorded values would be calculated automatically. 
									To attract rodents to the system, also a food bait trap is used. To detect when a rodent is in the system, we use the weight sensor which constantly records weight detected. When a threshold is met, all the other sensors and the camera are triggered. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The completed the system worked as intended and met all the requirements given by the researcher. He was completely satisfied with the system and said he intended to put it to use in the coming months.

									<h5>Development Process</h5>
									<p>
										Our team consisted of 3 people working in an agile environment. 
										We held weekly meetings with our professor and monthly meetings with our client to report progress and get feedback on it. I was in charge of writing the Python scripts on the Raspberry Pi that trigger the sensors and that collect the data. Besides that I also worked on setting up the hardware and on the validation of the system.
