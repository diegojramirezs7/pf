							<h2>Voice Recognition and Authentication System</h2>

								<h3>Project Description</h3>
								<p>
									As part of a final project, we met with a client who wanted to have a completely hands-free authentication process for his company. So, the goal of this project was to build a complete system that would allow employees or guests to be authenticated by only using their voice. The main features to be implemented were: 
									<ul class="alt">
										<li>Speech recognition (speech-to-text conversion)</li>
										<li>
											Allow the user to say different commands (Register, Verify Me, etc)
										</li>
										<li>Authenticating users by their voice </li>
										<li>
											Providing a confidence rating for the authentication process 
										</li>
										<li>
											Providing audio feedback of results (text-to-speech conversion).
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<p>
									After doing extensive research, we found 3 APIs that could be perfectly integrated into our system to meet all the former requirements. For text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion we used Google's Voice API, and for the authentication process we combined 2 APIs for extra security (Azure Cognitive Services and VoiceIt). We implemented a server that integrates all the APIs, handles requests from the client on the Raspberry Pi and the web UI, and connects to the MySQL database to retrieve and save user data. Additionally, a web interface was included for easier user management (creating, retrieving, updating, deleting users). Both the script on the RPi and the server were written in Python. Python was chosen due to the extensive set of libraries that allowed us to implement the features more easily. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Upon integration of all the components, we successfully implemented a system that satisfied all of the mentioned requirements, and some other implicit ones. After a lot of testing, we managed to create a smooth user experience in which users can register, get authenticated and give voice commands to the system while the system talks back to the through a speaker. User authentications consistently returned a confidence rating above 85%. Both our professor and our client were extremely satisfied and we got an "A as a grade".

									<h5>Development Process</h5>
									<p>
										Our team consisted of 3 people working in an agile environment. 
										We held weekly meetings with our client and professor to report progress, answer questions, to get feedback on our progress and for occasional updates on requirements. I was personally in charge of writing the Python code on the server that was the central part of the system and the code for the web UI. For code validation we used peer code reviews and extensive testing both on our own and with the client.
