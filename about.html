								<h3>Something About Me</h3>
								<p>
									About a year before I finished high school, I decided that I wanted to study computer science in university. A lot of thought was put into that decision. But, honestly, up until that point I wasn't particularly excited about computers and I didn't really know much about software. For me, it was always clear that I wanted to major in something technical that involved a lot of problem solving and working with math. For some reason, I was completely unaware that computer science was even a career path I could take. After doing some research on what were the best technical fields to get into, computer science immediately grabbed my attention. It seemed like a perfect match in every way. I'd get to spend all day solving problems, understanding how these seeminlgy magical things work, building things that many other people could use, and working with really smart people on problems that someday might change the world. From that day, I've been in love with this field. I just didn't know how much of a geek I was. 
								</p>

								<p>
									On September 2015, I came to Canada to start my post-secondary education. I was excited and terrified, both at the same time. Before deciding on a university, I got to see and compare the courses offered at different institutions. The ones I liked the most were the ones from Thompson Rivers University. So, that's the university I chose. 5 years later, I'm absolutely satisfied with both of my decisions. After learning about advanced algorithms and data structures, artificial intelligence, operating systems, web development, among other things, I've come to realize that developing software is one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal. By working on the projects showed on this portfolio, and others, I believe I have gained a solid understanding of software development and significant experience to hit the ground running on any new environment and opportunity that comes my way.

									<h5>Soft Skills</h5>
									<ul class="alt">
										<li>
											As an international student in Canada and someone who studied 2 semesters abroad in Germany, it's natural for me to be comfortable with change, adapting to new environments, and working with people with different backgrounds and skills. 
										</li>
										<li>
											By working with different types of clients with a wide range of expectations, I successfully managed to turn loosely defined requirements and ideas about a project into fully working and well-designed applications that exceeded client expectations. All of which turned into "A" grades in the respective course. 
										</li>
										<li>
											Through my experience working in agile environments with Scrum, I'm used to reporting weekly progress, meeting weekly deadlines, and meeting constantly with clients to get feedback and aliviate concerns.
										</li>
										<li>
											Probably the thing in which I take the most pride is that I'm for the most part a self-taught person. Even though I have an university degree, a significant amount of my knowledge about software development has came from online tutorials, books and just reading whatever I can find. Some of the things I've learned mostly on my own are: Python, React, working with APIs and servers, and playing guitar.
